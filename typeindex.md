## Type Basics [section-basics]
### Type Anatomy[section-basics-anatomy]
Identifiable type forms and characteristics

* Aperture
	* Description: The open space in the partially enclosed, somewhat rounded negative space of a letter form or symbol (or open counter).
	* AKA: open counter
	* Examples: Characters containing an aperture include c, e, g, h, m, n, s, u, C, G, S, and U
* Apex
	* Description: The point at the top of a character--such as the uppercase A--where the vertical strokes meet. The apex may be a sharp point, blunt, hallow, extended or rounded.
	* AKA: top
	* Examples: The tops of the letters A, M, N, and W
* Arc
* Arm
	* Description: The arm of a letter is the horizontal stroke that does not connect to a vertical stroke or stem at one or both ends. The top of the capital T and the horizontal strokes of the F and E are examples of arms. Additionally, the diagonal upward stroke on a K is its arm. Sometimes arm is used interchangeably with bar or crossbar or cross stroke.

		Arm is often also used to describe the mostly horizontal top stroke of C, double-storey a, G, and other glyphs, to include the finial, terminal, spur, or other elements of the stroke.
		* AKA: crossbar, cross stroke
		* Examples: The arms of an uppercase F connect to the stem only at one end and the arm of an uppercase T sits at the top of the stem and doesn't connect at either end. In contrast a cross stroke intersects the stem of a lowercase t or f and the cross bar connects the diagonal strokes of an uppercase A or the vertical stems of an H.
* Ascender
	* Description: The descender may be a stem (p, q without a loop), a stroke (y without a loop), a loop (double-storey g), or a tail (Q, regular g).
	* AKA: extender
	* Examples: The stem of the letters b, d, h, k, and l that extends above the x-height.
* Axis
	* Description: An imaginary line drawn from top to bottom of a glyph (letter or character of type) bisecting the upper and lower strokes that indicates the angle of stress. The inclination of the axis of the lowercase o is used to measure the angle of stress. A completely vertical axis indicates an angle of 0 or vertical stress, while an axis that leans to the left or right has angled (positive or negative) stress. Early styles of typography usually shared the same axis or stress angles.
	* AKA: stress, angle of stress
	* Examples: Old Style fonts, based on ancient Roman inscriptions, typically have a left-leaning or negative axis while Transitional styles that evolved later had less stress or a closer to vertical axis.
* Baseline
	* Description: The imaginary line where a line of text appears to rest and below which descenders extend. The baseline combined with the height of the lowercase x define the x-height. The vertical distance between two baselines makes up  the line height or leading. This vertical distance is used to create a vertical rhythm or vertical grid of a page.
	* Examples: Letters such as i, m, n, w, x and z sit on the baseline while letters such as a, c, e, o, s, and u have an overshoot and sit just below the baseline.
* Beak
* Bowl
	* Description: The curved part of the character that encloses the circular or curved parts of some letters, such as d, b, o, D, and B. Some also consider the straight side of a closed counter to be a bowl. This includes both sides of an a, both parts of a double-storey g and the straight stem on a D or B. The curved strokes of a C are also sometimes referred to as bowls although they aren't closed.

		The shape and size of the counter and bowl can affect readability and is also an identifying factor for some typefaces. At small sizes or at low resolution the bowls of some letters may fill in and appear solid.
	* Examples: The bowl usually refers to the main, enclosed circular portion of some characters and not usually the curved loops that may be a part of the extenders or other flourishes on letters such as the double-storey g, cursive b, d, l or y.
* Bracket
	* Description: The transitional element of a character that connects a stem with a serif. Often this takes the form of a curve, but could also be a sharp angle. In cases where there is no transition from the stem to the serif—such as in many Didones—the character has no bracket.
	* AKA: bracketed serif, fillet
* Cap Line
	* Description: The height from the baseline to the top of the uppercase letters excluding the overshoot. The cap height is not always the same as the ascending line of a fonts ascending letters.
	* Examples: The flat top of a capital H, T or W will define the Cap Line.
* Counter
	* Description: The enclosed or partially enclosed circular or curved negative space (white space) of some letters such as d, o, and s. The term counter may sometimes be used to refer only to a closed space, with open counter referring to the partially enclosed spaces in m, n, or h.
	* AKA: aperture, inner space, enclosed space
	* Examples: Letters containing closed counters include A, B, D, O, P, Q, R, a, b, d, e, g, o, p, and q. Letters containing open counters include c, f, h, i, s etc. The digits 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 also possess a counter(s).
* Crossbar
	* Description: The (usually) horizontal stroke that connects two stems, such as in an A or H. Although often used interchangeably, the crossbar differs from an arm and a cross stroke because each end connects to a stem or stroke and doesn't (usually) intersect/cross over the stem or stroke.
	* AKA: bar, arm, cross stroke
	* Examples: The cross bar connects the diagonal strokes of an uppercase A or the vertical stems of an H. In contrast, the cross stroke intersects the stem of a lowercase t or f while the arms of an uppercase F connect to the stem only at one end.
* Cross Stroke
* Crotch
	* Description: An acute, interior angle where two angled strokes meet, similar to the junction of two limbs of a tree.
	* Examples: The interior angle of the letter V is it's crotch.
* Descender
	* Description: The portion of some letters, such as g, y and Q, that extends or descends below the baseline is the descender. Some typefaces, also use descenders on old-style numerials (typically 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9).
	* AKA: extender, tail, loop
	* Examples: The descender may be a stem (p, q without a loop), a stroke (y without a loop), a loop (double-storey g), or a tail (Q, regular g).
* Diacritic
	* Description: An accent mark that aids in pronunciation. In many non-English Latin languages, it is used to differentiate homonyms. For example, the acute diacritical over the letter e changes the pronunciation to more of a long a as in resumé and café. The most common diacriticals are acute, cedilla, circumflex, grave, tilde, and umlaut.
	* AKA: accents, accent marks
	* Examples: The list of possible diacritics is extensive and varies greatly depending on the language of the text, though â (circumflex), é (acute), ç (cedilla), ü (umlaut), ñ (tilde) are some common examples of the use of diacritics.
* Diagonal Stroke
	* Description: An angled stroke that often connects to a stem.
	* Examples: The angled lines of an A, M, N, V, and Z are all diagonal strokes.
* Discretionary Ligature
	* Description: Certain typefaces have a ligature that is somewhat more unusual, and it is left up to the designer to chose to use these ligatures. They are rarely used in body copy, but often used in display type or logotypes to create an additional typographic flourish.
* Dot
* Double-Storey Form
* Ear
	* Description: The decorative flourish found on the lower case ‘g’, projecting from the upper right side of the bowl.
* Extender
	* Description: A somewhat generic term that can refer to either an ascender or a descender.
	* Examples: These characters all have ascenders or decenders, and are thus considered to have extenders: b, d, g, k, p, q
* Eye
	* Description: Similar to a counter, specifically the enclosed space in a lowercase e.
	* AKA: counter
* Finial
	* Description: The end of a letterform that is a tapered or curved.
	* AKA: terminal
	* Examples: The lower terminal on the letters c and e as well as the upper terminal of a double-story a are finials.
* Hairline
	* Description: The thinnest stroke found in a typeface that consists of strokes of varying widths.
	* AKA: hair stroke
	* Examples: The hairline is most obvious is high contrast faces such as modern Diodones.
* Leg
	* Description: The lower, angled stroke of the K, k or R excluding the serif.
	* AKA: Tail
* Ligature
	* Description: An optional connection between two or more characters to create a more visually appealing arrangement of the characters. The designer may opt to use ligatures in situations when characters repeat (such as "ff") to create a more dynamic shape or when the dot of a character might intersect with another character (such as "fi"). Some modern fonts expand the concept by offering extensive swashes or alternate characters that are created through the use of ligatures.
	* Examples: ff, fi, ffi, ft, st
* Link
* Lobe
* Loop
* Meanline
	* Description:
* Hook
* Open Counter
	* Description: The partially enclosed circular or curved negative space (white space) of a letter as in c, e, m, n, or h.
	* AKA: aperture
* Overshoot
	* Description: If the lowercase "o" where the same height as an "x," it would appear shorter to the eye. To maintain a visually consistent size, type designers extend the tops and bottoms of certain characters beyond both the baseline and x-height for lowercase letters, or beyond the baseline and cap height for uppercase letters.
	* Examples: Though it varies by typeface, these characters often utilize overshoot: a, c, m, o, s, A, C, O, Q, S
* Quaint
* Serif
* Shoulder
	* Description: The curve reaching out from the leg of a character, such as in an m or n.
	* AKA: arch
* Spine
	* Description: The main left to right curving stroke in an upper and lower case S. The spine may be almost vertical or mostly horizontal, depending on the typeface.
* Spur
	* Description: Similar to a serif or beak, a spur is a small projection at the end of the curved portions of letterforms, such as the end(s) of a C or S, the middle of a G or where the curved taper meets a stem as in a b, d, p or q.
	* AKA: serif, barb, cat’s ear
* Stem
	* Description: The stem is the primary--and most often vertical--stroke of a letterform excluding any serifs. In most fonts the stem is roughly the same thickness as the other strokes of the form. In high contrast typefaces, the stem may be distinctively thicker or thinner than the other strokes.
	* AKA: stroke
	* Examples: Not all letters have a stem, such as C or S. The vertical, non-curved portions of L, l, d, B, and p are examples of stems. H, N, and M have two stems each. Some letterforms such as y and A may have a sloped or diagonal stem.
* Stroke
* Tail
* Teardrop Terminal
* Tittle
	* Description: A small mark or dot above a lowercase i or j.
	* AKA: dot
* X-Height
	* Description: An relative measurement that is the vertical distance from the baseline to the top of the lowercase "x" character in a typeface. Other lowercase characters are often a similar height to the x—such as the v, w and z—but the x is used as the top of the character is usually the closest to flat and level on many typefaces. Faces with a larger x-height are often more readable, but will likely take up more space.
	* AKA: meanline
