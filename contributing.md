Contributing to TypeGuide
===================

TypeGuide is an open document, it depends on contributions from the community. Feel free to add or edit sections, topics, references or details. Keep in mind that TypeGuide is meant to be an introductory reference for those new to typography while still being useful to anyone more knowledgable.

Top Level Sections should be set as a list item in the table of contents with a reference link `[section-example]` directing to a second level heading `## Example` within the document. Second Level Sections should be a sub-list item in the table of contents with a reference link `[section-example-sub-example]` directing to a third level heading `### Example` within the document. Third Level Sections donâ€™t require a table of contents entry, but should be formatted as a fourth level heading `#### Example`. Topics and References should be list items and sub-list items within a section, ordered alphabetically. The exception to this rule is topics that rely on prior knowledge of a previous topic, typically seen in the Type Basics section.
