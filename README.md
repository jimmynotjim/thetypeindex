# [TypoGuideMe][1]
A collection of definitions, best practices and resources on typography.

## Features
TypeGuide is a series of documents that aim to introduce the foundations of typography and provide resources for further education. It will be made up of two parts, [the website][1] where anyone can easily access and search the content, and an API, available to those that would like to source the content to build their own tools.

## Contributing
TypeGuide is an open document, it depends on contributions from the community. Feel free to add or edit sections, topics, references or details. Keep in mind that TypeGuide is meant to be an introductory reference for those new to typography while still being useful to those more knowledgable.

While the backend is being finished, the typoguide.md document will serve as a master layout, please keep everything within it for now. Top Level Sections should be set as a list item in the table of contents with a reference link `[section-example]` directing to a second level heading `## Example` within the document. Second Level Sections should be a sub-list item in the table of contents with a reference link `[section-example-sub-example]` directing to a third level heading `### Example` within the document. Third Level Sections don’t require a table of contents entry, but should be formatted as a fourth level heading `#### Example`. Topics and References should be list items and sub-list items within a section, ordered alphabetically. The exception to the ordering rule is topics that rely on prior knowledge of another topic, typically seen in the Type Basics section. 

If none of this makes any sense, don’t worry, just hit me up with your suggestions
