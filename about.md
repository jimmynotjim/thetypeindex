The first real type resource, maybe even design resource, I ever found was _Thinking with Type_ by Ellen Lupton. I had already become intersted in design, but itâ€™s what set my course for the years that followed. From that book on, I was hooked on type.


_The Type Index_ originally started as a collection of saved references while doing research for <a href="http://typecardsapp.com">typecards</a>, a proof-of-concept for early touch interactions and css animation on the web. While typecards is no longer in active development (and who knows, maybe it'll come back some day), I didn't want all that research to go to waste. Originally, the collection moved to a markdown file as TypoGuideMe, but I never really liked that name, and in the meantime <a href="#">Typo Guide</a> went live.

As time went on, I kept coming back to the idea of providing the collection as an index, available for anyone to use, even to reuse in their own app or website. When I finally sat down to hash out the details, I decided on three rules. First, the content should be available to anyone, even if they just ape this site. I've gained a lot professionally from the Open Source Community, and it's only right to give back to it. Second, the data should be easily managed, without a CMS or complex backend. Third, it should be easy for anyone, including a newer designer or developer to contribute. The solution was the stack of JSON files running this site.
